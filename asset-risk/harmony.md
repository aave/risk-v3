# Harmony

[Snapshot to deploy V2 on Harmony](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmYYBedL9aRFdC5DUgjN3QMoYxvJhAUBb2sEyhFuVQZbLG) passed with a success. But with V3 launch soon deployments were postponed.

Now the Aave Protocol V3 has been deployed on Harmony. Harmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain, operated by over 100 external validators. It is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Read more about [üëâüèª Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/)
