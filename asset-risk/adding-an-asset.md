# Adding an Asset

Aave enables users to supply and borrow digital assets through liquidity pools. Suppliers receive protocol-issued aTokens, which represent the user‚Äôs supplied assets and accrued yield. Each borrow is secured by collateral acting as a risk mitigation tool against default.
More details on how the protocol works can be found in [Aave‚Äôs Technical Paper](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/techpaper/Aave_V3_Technical_Paper.pdf).

Given the specificities of Aave V3, the üëáüèª linked assets are appropriate based on the following considerations:

- [Polygon V3 market assets](polygon.md#related-smart-contracts)
- [Harmony V3 market assets](harmony.md#related-smart-contracts)
- [Avalanche V3 market assets](avalanche.md#related-smart-contracts)
- [Arbitrum V3 market assets](arbitrum.md#related-smart-contracts)
- [Optimism V3 market assets](optimism.md#related-smart-contracts)
- [Fantom V3 market assets](fantom.md#related-smart-contracts)

1. **Each additional token slightly increase the gas cost of the borrow and redeem actions permanently.** The token must be included in the smart contract, adding complexity and thus costs.

2. **Each token added to Aave protocol as collateral increases the protocol risk of insolvency.** From a financial perspective, the token enabled as Collateral can be considered as assets of Aave Protocol, while the amount of tokens borrowed considered as the liabilities of the Aave Protocol. The underlying tokens of assets and liabilities often differ, with borrows mostly in stablecoins and tokens used as collateral being volatile tokens. Thus, it is crucial that while adding new token to the market Aave Community make following considerations:

    - Only assets with low risk profile should be supported as collateral
    - Riskier assets should either not be enable as collatoral or enabled only in Isolation mode
    - New assets with higher risk and lower liquidity should be only considered listed in Isolation mode (for both borrow and collateral use)

{% hint style="info" %}
To mitigate the protocol risk of insolvency, V3 allows to list new riskier token in *Isolation Mode*. Read more [üëâüèª Isolation Mode](https://docs.aave.com/developers/whats-new/isolation-mode)
{% endhint %}

3. **A centralised asset accepted as collateral exposes the protocol to centralisation risk.** The single point of failure risks of underlying tokens flow into the Aave Protocol.

4. **Assets that have risk of manipulable oracles are listed as single borrow assets (i.e. if a user borrows said asset, they cannot borrow any other asset (a/k/a Siloed assets)).

5. Tokens only enabled for supplying and borrowing (i.e., not usable as collateral) present lower risk for the protocol. Collateral are the assets of the protocol. To remain solvent, these assets must remain greater than the crypto assets borrowed from the protocol. Tokens which can only be used for borrowing should always be excessively backed by collateral assets (e.g., a user can supply DAI as collateral and borrow DAI in variable mode backed by DAI as collateral; however, this is not the case for agEUR which is not usable as collateral and must always be backed by less risky assets).

6. **Having liquidity from different tokens in our pools reduces risks via diversification benefits.**

When adding a token to the protocol, significant analysis must be made by the Aave community to ensure that the asset will add more value than risk. Only tokens with a worthy product and significant community are considered. The asset risk methodology offers a framework to assess and compare tokens‚Äô risks to the protocol, and how to calibrate model asset parameters to mitigate those risks.

{% hint style=‚Äúinfo‚Äù %} V3 of Aave protocol introduce new `ASSET_LISTING_ADMIN` role, assigned by Aave Governance, which allows holders of this role to: - add new assets to the Aave V3 markets - update asset oracle sources - update fallback oracles {% endhint %}

{% hint style=‚Äúinfo‚Äù %} See the [Governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/governance/) for the new asset listing process. {% endhint %}
