# Optimism

Following the [Aave DAO snapshot approval](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xba58ab5e24dcaef5490fd8717320f74e3c85aea36811d421b48822d4069b6d45), the Aave Protocol V3 has been deployed on Optimism. Optimism is a Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup network designed to utilize the strong security guarantees of Ethereum while reducing its cost and latency. Optimism is EVM equivalent, making the transition from L1 to L2 as seamless as possible.
