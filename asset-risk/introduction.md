# Introduction

The composability of the DeFi ecosystem implies risks from an individual component flow into all dependent systems. Reserves are at the heart of the Aave protocol as they enable operations and hold the assets and liabilities of the protocol.

This documentation presents a framework to assess the risk of tokens for the Aave Protocol Markets. The risk methodology considers market, counter-party and smart contract risks for the tokens selected for Aave protocol, aiming to contribute to higher risk standards within DeFi.
