# Introduction

Aave is a liquidity protocol that enables borrowing different crypto assets from the liquidity pools. Suppliers receive aTokens, when they supply crypto assets to the pools.&#x20;

The liquidity of the protocol is the availability of the assets to face business operations: borrowing amounts and redeeming aTokens. It is a key metric, as lack of liquidity will block operations.

At any point in time, the liquidity of the protocol can be assessed through the utilisation ratio: the share of reserve that is currently borrowed vs Aave supply of each asset.

Liquidity risk mitigation tools exist with the [borrow interest rate model ](borrow-interest-rate.md) and alternative sources of aToken liquidity.
