# aToken Liquidity

An additional tool to mitigate aTokensâ€™ liquidity risk is to provide alternative sources of liquidity enabling users to redeem aTokens even when there is no liquidity available in the protocol.

Aave has set up liquidity pools on Uniswap and Balancer to add sources of liquidity. As well as the [Aave Curve pool](https://www.curve.fi/aave/stats) with over $30 million of aDAI + aUSDC + aUSDT.
