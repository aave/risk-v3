# Aave's Risk Framework

With billions of locked assets, Decentralised Finance (DeFi) has boomed in recent years.&#x20;Aave Protocol  launched on Ethereum mainnet in January 2020, now among the top money markets for depositors and borrowers.&#x20;

The industry has been forming industry standards to manage the risks emerging from the hyper connected ecosystem. Aave V2 holds security at its core with audits by Consensys Diligence, CertiK and Certora as detailed in Security & Audits.

The following documentation analyses the fundamental risks of the protocol and describes the processes in place to mitigate them.

An [Aave Market Risk Assessment](https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave),  has been produced by the quantitative modelling team of Gauntlet Networks. Aave V1, V2 and the Safety Module have been stress tested via agent based simulation. The simulations show the model is currently able to remain solvent under extreme market conditions, showing appropriate risk management. As a result, Gauntlet Network provided some parameter suggestion to further reduce the risk of insolvency.
