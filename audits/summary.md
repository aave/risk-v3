# Introduction

As the Aave ecosystem grows, so do the sums at risks making the protocol a higher value target. Security is the top priority, in addition to internal best pratices with automated testing, the Aave ecosystem is assessed by independent experts. All aspects of the protocol are covered by the analysis described below: V1, V2, V3, the $AAVE token, the Safety Module and Governance. Some experts focused on the security of the smart contracts, others on the logic of the algorithms or stress testing the protocol under extreme market conditions. Audit reports available on [Github](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/tree/master/audits).
